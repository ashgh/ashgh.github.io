# Playing for Equality - Project Justice
This is a simple repo for the static site PFEPJ, an fundraiser to help with the racial inequality and injustices in today's world.  
  
Inspired by Extra-Life, we want to run a 24-hour video game marathon stream that will help raise money and bring awareness and education to supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.
